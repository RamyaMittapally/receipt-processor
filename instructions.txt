Step 1: Install Docker and a REST API client

Install Docker 

Use a REST API client like Postman, or use curl in the terminal

Step 2: Log in to Docker Hub

Open terminal and run:
docker login

Step 3: Pull and run the Docker image

Run the following commands to run my docker files:
docker pull ramyamittapally/receipt-processor-app:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 ramyamittapally/receipt-processor-app:latest
localhost and host port both are 8080 for me.


If port 8080 is already in use on your system, change the host port:
docker run -p 9090:8080 ramyamittapally/receipt-processor-app:latest

Use http://localhost:9090 instead of 8080 in the next steps if you changed the port

Step 4: Send a POST request to process a receipt

URL: http://localhost:8080/receipts/process

Method: POST

Header: Content-Type = application/json

Body:
{
"retailer": "Target",
"purchaseDate": "2022-01-01",
"purchaseTime": "13:01",
"items": [
{"shortDescription": "Mountain Dew 12PK", "price": "6.49"},
{"shortDescription": "Emils Cheese Pizza", "price": "12.25"}
],
"total": "18.74"
}

You will receive a response with an ID like "3f5a8b4d"

Step 5: Use the ID to get reward points

URL format: http://localhost:8080/receipts/{id}/points
